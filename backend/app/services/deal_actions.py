"""Executors for the AI-native deal engine's tools (see services/deal_engine.py).

The model ASKS; this module DECIDES. Every executor validates against the tenant's own
configuration and the session row, and returns a refusal message (which the caller feeds
back to the model) instead of doing anything unsafe:

  - prices and amounts come from config / the session snapshot, never from tool arguments
  - a payment link is refused until every required detail is saved or skipped
  - a paid session can never be re-selected or get a second link
  - at most one menu per turn

Session reads and writes go through intake's own helpers (looked up as module attributes at
call time), so the Deals-board sync, the staleness sweep, the Razorpay webhook and the Astro
bridge keep working on the same intake_sessions rows.
