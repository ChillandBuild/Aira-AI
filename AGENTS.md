# Aira AI — Codex Operating Manual

## Core Commands
- **Backend Dev**: `make dev-backend` (safe mode: scheduler paused, outbound dry-run). Never plain `uvicorn` on a laptop — it shares the live DB, so the scheduler would message real leads.
- **Backend Build/Deps**: `cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Backend Test**: `cd backend && python -m pytest` (runs tests under `backend/tests/`). Use `python -m pytest`, not bare `pytest` — several test modules import `app.*` without adding the backend dir to `sys.path`, so bare `pytest` fails at collection.
- **Frontend Dev**: `cd frontend && npm run dev`
- **Frontend Build**: `cd frontend && npm run build`
- **Frontend Typecheck**: `cd frontend && npm run typecheck`
- **Frontend Lint**: `cd frontend && npm run lint`
- **Production Run (Render)**: `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT` (executed from `backend/` directory)

## How to Work Efficiently (low context — this is the DEFAULT, no need to be told)
- The brain is **queried, not loaded**. Never read whole files or the whole wiki "to get context."
- Lookup order for ANY task: (1) find the exact file:line — `graphify query "<question>"` if `graphify` is installed AND `graphify-out/` exists, otherwise a targeted Grep/Glob for the symbol or UI string (as of 2026-10-13 neither graphify nor `graphify-out/` exists on the Windows machine), (2) the ONE relevant `graphify-out/wiki/<Module>.md` (when present) or `.agents/context/subsystem-notes.md` section, (3) at most 2–3 targeted reads. Full-file reads are the last resort.
- Pull ONLY the `.agents/` file the task scope points to (below) — never preload all of them.
- **Database/schema work:** the wiki is CODE only. Use the migration index in [decisions/log.md](.agents/decisions/log.md) + live Supabase `list_tables`/`execute_sql` — NOT the wiki.
- This runs automatically for every task; the user does NOT have to say "use the wiki/graph."

## How we work — the sprint (every task, no need to be told)

> Still applies: push or deploy only when the user says so, and the pre-commit checks
> (pytest, typecheck, lint) still run as before.

- Bug, error, "it stopped working" → find the root cause before any fix;
  a regression test that fails before the fix and passes after.
- New feature or idea → write the plan → show the plan and wait for approval → build.
- UI change → review the design in the plan before building; after building, run a UI QA pass
  as the UI test tenant — on the live site, or locally. Local backend ONLY via `make dev-backend`
  (plain uvicorn would run the scheduler and message real leads from the live DB; see
  subsystem-notes.md). Point the local frontend at it with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000.
- Auth, webhooks, payments, RLS → also a security review.
- Before any commit → run the checks that fit the change (review the diff, `python -m pytest` for
  backend, typecheck + lint for frontend), without asking. Do NOT repeat a check that already passed on the same
  code: if no code or test file changed since the last passing run, or the change is docs/config only, skip it and
  just commit. Push only when the user says so.
- Before finishing → `git fetch`, check `HEAD..origin/main` for teammate commits on the
  same files; if any, rebase and re-run the tests.
- Weekly → a short retro: what shipped, what broke.
- A push to `main` auto-deploys the backend on Render. Push or deploy only when the user says so, every time.
- Rough or voice-typed idea → `/brief <idea>` first. It shows a short brief and waits for "go" (see
  `.agents/skills/source-command-brief/SKILL.md`; glossary in `.agents/context/prem-glossary.md`).

## Agent Routing Instructions
To prevent context dilution, general invariants and rules have been split into modular guides. **Always read these files first based on the scope of your task:**

1.  **Identity, Dev Persona & Code Style Rules**:
    *   Location: [.agents/context/identity.md](.agents/context/identity.md)
    *   Read when: You start a new session or need to review coding styles, formatting preferences, and file/API response conventions.
2.  **Invariants, Tech Stack & File Map**:
    *   Location: [.agents/context/stack-and-rules.md](.agents/context/stack-and-rules.md)
    *   Read when: Modifying DB calls, working with WhatsApp/TeleCMI webhooks, routing outbound calls, or checking security policies (RLS).
3.  **Historical Decisions & DB Migrations**:
    *   Location: [.agents/decisions/log.md](.agents/decisions/log.md)
    *   Read when: Seeking context on why specific modules (e.g., Bot Flow Builder) were dropped, checking migration histories, or verifying schema structures.
4.  **Active Roadmap & Technical Debt**:
    *   Location: [.agents/projects/active-backlog.md](.agents/projects/active-backlog.md)
    *   Read when: Checking current backlog tasks or reviewing known tech debt (e.g., orphaned tables).
5.  **Subsystem Notes & Load-Bearing Gotchas**:
    *   Location: [.agents/context/subsystem-notes.md](.agents/context/subsystem-notes.md)
    *   Read when: Editing broadcasts/delivery, scoring, call evaluation, knowledge RAG, frontend perf, telecalling, chat escalation, or operator console — holds the *why* and the traps the wiki can't.
6.  **Security & Vulnerability Guidance**:
    *   Location: [.agents/context/security-checklist.md](.agents/context/security-checklist.md)
    *   Read when: Touching auth, webhooks, payments (Razorpay), file uploads, RLS policies, or any route reading `tenant_id`.
7.  **AI Reply Master Prompt**:
    *   Location: [docs/whatsapp-master-prompt.md](docs/whatsapp-master-prompt.md)
    *   Read when: Touching `_build_base_prompt()` / `ai_reply.py`'s prompt assembly — this is the canonical text.
