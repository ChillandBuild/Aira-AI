"""AI-native selling: the prompt blocks, tool schemas and guardrails that let the main
reply brain sell packages, collect a client's required details and send the payment link
itself, instead of a fixed step-by-step script (services/intake.route_intake).

Design: docs/plans/ai-native-conversation.md.

This module is the pure half: config in, text or schemas out. The executors that touch
the session store and Razorpay live in services/deal_actions.py; the model round-trip is
converse_once in the same file as the executors' caller. Money rules are enforced there,
never trusted to the model: prices come from config, the link comes from Razorpay, and a
link is refused until every required detail is saved or skipped.
