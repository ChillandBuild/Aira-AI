# Aira AI — Security & Vulnerability Guidance

Read this when touching: auth, webhooks (WhatsApp/Instagram/Facebook/Telegram), payments (Razorpay), file uploads, any route reading `tenant_id`, or anything under `routes/` that writes/reads leads, calls, or recordings.

## Hard checks (from stack-and-rules.md — don't re-derive, verify against code)
1. **Tenant isolation** — every table RLS-enabled (migration 114); app layer also gates via `get_tenant_and_role()`. New table/route → confirm both layers, not just one.
2. **Webhook signatures** — WhatsApp inbound must verify `X-Hub-Signature-256` before processing; invalid sig returns 200 but drops the payload (never 4xx — Meta retries storms on non-200).
3. **`anon` role** — no EXECUTE on SECURITY DEFINER functions. New definer function → revoke `anon` explicitly in the migration.
4. **Provider keys are per-tenant** — never add a platform-level fallback key for AI/WhatsApp/Voice providers (see stack-and-rules.md Provider Decisions). A shared fallback key is a tenant-isolation break, not just a config smell.
5. **Call recordings** — Supabase Storage only, never local disk (invariant #5). Check any new recording-handling code doesn't write to `/tmp` or similar and forget to clean up.
6. **Broadcast gate** — bulk-send must reject leads with null `opt_in_source`; DNC (`do_not_call`) and `opted_out` are separate flags, don't conflate.

## Standard checklist (apply per OWASP-style categories — see skill `security-review` for full code patterns)
- **Secrets**: env vars only, never in source; check `.env` files aren't committed before any commit.
- **Input validation**: Pydantic v2 schemas on all FastAPI route bodies; reject unknown/malformed payloads.
- **SQL**: Supabase client / parameterized queries only, no string-built SQL.
- **Payments (Razorpay)**: verify webhook signatures on Razorpay callbacks before marking a payment link paid; never trust client-reported payment status.
- **Rate limiting**: webhook and broadcast endpoints are the ones actually worth limiting here (external retries + bulk-send abuse potential) — check before adding new public-facing routes.
- **Error responses**: no stack traces or internal Supabase errors surfaced to the frontend; log detail server-side only.

## Where to look, in order
1. `graphify query "<question>"` for exact file:line on the subsystem you're touching.
2. This file's Hard checks above — confirm against actual code with a targeted grep, don't assume from memory.
3. `.agents/decisions/log.md` for why a security-relevant call was made a certain way (e.g. RLS migration history).
4. Full `security-review` skill for generic code-pattern examples (Next.js/TS-flavored — adapt, don't copy verbatim since backend is FastAPI/Python).

## When to escalate to a full pass
Run `security-reviewer` agent (not just this checklist) when: new auth/authz code, new webhook endpoint, new payment code path, or any change touching RLS policies directly.
